The last few years have been very turbulent. A pandemic, a [lawsuit](/urteil-im-markenrechtsstreit/), the [search for a new house](/das-verschw%C3%B6rhaus-ist-ausgezogen-die-r%C3%A4ume-am-weinhof-sind-nun-leer/) and the [renaming of the community and e.V. to temporÃ¤rhaus](/stellungnahme-und-ausblick-zum-urteil-im-markenrechtsstreit/) have kept us all on our toes. But now the time has finally come: on Saturday, 16th of September, we will open the doors of our new house in Neu-Ulm for the first time for the Kulturnacht (culture night), a house that we have been preparing together with the [Haus der Nachhaltigkeit](https://www.h-d-n.org) (HdN) since May and which we will now finally open together! ðŸ¥³

We have already teased a few first impressions of the renovation phase on social media and our [website](/der-umbau-geht-voran--und-du-kannst-uns-helfen/). Now that the renovation is largely complete, everything looks even more colourful, bigger, and more beautiful! ðŸ¤©

As in previous years, we have of course prepared an [exciting programme](https://www.kulturnacht-ulm.de/web/kulturnacht/besucher/programm/programmdetail.php?id=2084) for the Kulturnacht. We'll be open from 19:00 to 01:00 and show you digital art and other bits in the spacious premises. Thanks to a joint performance with the HdN, there will even be live music this time! Look forward to the following programme provided by us:

 * Screen printing: feel free to bring textiles that you would like to have screen printed :)
 * Exhibitions on the current AI hype
 * Retro co-op gaming
 * Guided tours through the new rooms

In addition, the HdN will have its own programme. So it's worth taking a look at the Neu-Ulm side of the Danube! You can find us at [Augsburgerstr. 23-25](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/10889781438) in Neu-Ulm, which is easy to reach on foot.

**Unfortunately, you don't have time on Kulturnacht?**<br>
No problem! Immediately after the Kulturnacht, we'll be offering some of our familiar formats on a regular basis again, starting with a Maker Monday on 18.09.2023. You'll soon find all the other dates in our [calendar ðŸ“…](/en/termine-und-oeffnungszeiten/) again as usual.

We look forward to seeing you!<br>
Your temporÃ¤rhaus-Community

*PS: We have finally managed to get a hang of this 'digitalisation' and there is now [a form](/en/verein) to become a supporting member of the temporÃ¤rhaus e.V. ðŸ˜‰*
