Using a 360° camera, we take pictures [at irregular intervals](/tag/panorama/) that allow you to see our space in interactive tours on the web. Recently, we finally took the time to get the pictures from the camera and create some new tours.

At [temporaerhaus.de/tour/](/tour/), you will now find three new views of our space:
- [2023, before moving in](/tour/2023-empty/) to the former sports store, before we brought all our stored belongings in
- [End of 2023](/tour/2023/), after the opening for Kulturnacht and a few months of operation
- <span style="color: #aaa;">2024 we actually forgot to take photos of a tour /o\ </span>
- And, relatively recent: [2025](/tour/2025/), a tour of the space towards the end of 2025. After around two years of operation and many wonderful changes since we moved into the current building.

If you haven't visited us in Neu-Ulm yet, the next few weeks would be the perfect opportunity to do so — because unfortunately, our temporary use of the former Sport Sohn building will end in 2026.
We are therefore once again looking for a really suitable long-term location. If anyone would like to give us some tips or even offer us some space, you can find [more information about our search here](/umzug/). Thank you in advance!

Feel free to click and browse through the house tours—or, even better, come by yourself on [one of the open dates](/termine-und-oeffnungszeiten/).
