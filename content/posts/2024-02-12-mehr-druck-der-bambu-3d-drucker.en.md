_This post is part of a series in which we want to present some of our new and valuable material that we were able to procure due to a grant by [Deutsche Stiftung für Engagement und Ehrenamt](https://www.deutsche-stiftung-engagement-und-ehrenamt.de/)._

Our Maker Mondays are one of the most popular offers in our space. 
3D printers, laser cutters and woodworking tools are not things that everyone simply has at home, and we are delighted to be able to meet the needs of people from Neu-Ulm and the surrounding area with our tools and equipment. 
We were already able to purchase an Ultimaker 5 with a large build chamber and two print heads from the last DSEE grant – but this machine was intended as a supplement to the two existing Ultimakers procured by the city. 
Since we resumed operations after our move to Neu-Ulm, this single 3D printer has been a bottleneck: we constantly have a high demand for 3D prints, but with just one printer, visitors were backing up and we had to send many designs to the print queue until the next Maker Monday.

To alleviate this situation, we ordered another 3D printer thanks to funding from DSEE. 
We thought long and hard about which printer we wanted to purchase. 
What's important in a makerspace is the best ratio of maintenance costs to printing time and actual successful prints. 
If you only print for yourself at home and have no problem optimizing and adapting your own printer, you can rarely go wrong with the standard kits on the market (usually copies of a [Prusa model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prusa_i3)). 
However, the necessary fine-tuning of the kit and usually also the replacement of safety-critical components – especially with some inexpensive kits that do not come from Prusa itself – are time-consuming and not always suited to a rather public setting like ours. 
It was therefore important to us to have a reliable and fast printer that is easy to use for as many users as possible so that we don't have to put too much effort into ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting – and at the same time have a good 3D printing experience.

When we initially moved into the original premises at Weinhof, we were already considering many of these aspects. 
Back then, we opted for printers from the Ultimaker series, which met many of our criteria (including printing via ethernet) given the state of the art at the time. 
In the meantime, however, the market has developed considerably. 
In the current range of available models, our choice therefore quickly fell on the Bambu X1 Carbon.

In addition to an impressive printing speed (which also clearly outshines our Ultimaker 5) and a relatively large print area, this printer offers a very special treat: the Automatic Material System AMS. 
AMS offers the possibility of printing up to four different colors or even different materials within one print.

Furthermore, the printer offers automatic detection of printing errors and the option of creating time-lapse videos with the built-in camera.

The printer has already proven itself at our Maker Mondays and has significantly reduced the bottleneck in 3D printing. 
The hand wheel shown in the time-lapse, for example, has become part of the 3D-printed printing press that was in use at the Chaos Communication Congress. 
We are excited to see what our users will create with these new possibilities.
