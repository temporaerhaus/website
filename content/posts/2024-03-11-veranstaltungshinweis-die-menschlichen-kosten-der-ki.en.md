On **Saturday, 16.03.2024, 16.00** a lecture will take place in cooperation with Freiraum / CCCUlm.

“The Human Cost of AI” to discuss how training data for machine learning and filtering out harmful/illegal materials from social media platforms have a great mental toll on the folks doing such work.

**Mophat Okinyi** is a recognised expert in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. As one of the many techworkers in Nairobi, he was instrumental in training the needed models and used to filter out illegal or harmful content during the development phase of ChatGPT.

As a human rights activist, board member of the African Content Moderators Union and CEO of Techworker Community Africa, Mophat is committed to fair working conditions and the professional development of African techworkers. One of his main concerns is the preservation of human dignity in the development of AI.

The talk will be held in English and will also be streamed live. The link to the stream on Saturday here.
