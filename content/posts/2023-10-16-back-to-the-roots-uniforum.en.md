Once again, we are returning to the roots from which we grew: The datalove university group (also known as UlmAPI) was the nucleus officially recognized by the student council in 2011, from which, among other things, the first Jugend hackt in Ulm emerged in 2015—and then the idea for a third place in the city. The rest, as they say, is history.

But we have never forgotten the university. That's why we're at the Uniforum today [not just digitally](https://stuve.uni-ulm.de/aktuelles/veranstaltungen/digitales-uniforum/freizeit-unterhaltung-und-netzwerk#c3143), but also to talk to and with exhibits to try out. We are very pleased that we are once again receiving a lot of interest from students, especially in the last few semesters, who are active at temporärhaus and enliven the datalove university group.

In addition to many links, for example to the university group for sustainability through our sewing café, the topic of mobility data naturally remains a popular perennial topic. And so today we are exhibiting a 3D printer, a Pong console made in the workshop and a Matelight as well as a best of the real-time public transport displays created at the university. That's where we came from, among other things—yet another back to the roots ;)
