Emergency phone number: +49 731 14116501 (**only** for emergency situations, please contact us via E-Mail for general requests. Use the contact information of [Haus der Nachhaltigkeit](https://www.h-d-n.org/) for reaching them.)


## Briefpostadresse

Our mailbox has a slightly different address to the [the actual main entrance](/en/das-haus/):

temporärhaus e.V.  
Augsburger Straße 25  
89231 Neu-Ulm


Please really **only send letters and postcards** there -- **parcels** are unfortunately too large and cannot be accepted there at this time.
Should it still be something larger, send us a mail (see above) and we organize a _Packstation_ address as recipient :)


## Address of our non-profit association

For _important, very serious_ official correspondence:

temporärhaus e.V.  
Eberhardtstr. 43
