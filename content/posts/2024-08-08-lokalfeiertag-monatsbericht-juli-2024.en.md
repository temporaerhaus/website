You can tell it's summer in the city: people frolicked on the Danube and other bodies of water in July and the streets emptied out as soon as the vacations began.
For us active people, the summer is also more about swimming than being indoors, but there was still plenty going on in front of and behind the scenes!

Like almost every month, a lot has happened in the **workshop** and **atelier**:
In the workshop, Seppi and Co are building new organizational aids week by week to be able to tidy up tools and sort construction aids into their right places.
In the atelier, both the ceramics workshop and the photography department made huge progress in July.
Firstly, Steffi and Patrick's pottery kiln was delivered and they successfully fired their first pottery pieces in it.
Do you want to engage in pottery too? Talk to them or keep an eye on our calendar for upcoming offers to learn or practice pottery together.
On the other hand, the vh Ulm has closed down its former **photo lab** and we were kindly offered to take over parts of it.
We are now one of several places where the vh's analog photography equipment will be given a new lease of life, for which we would like to say a big thank you!

Our **event and stage tech** has also been given a delightful upgrade. The setup with the sound and lighting mixer was a little overwhelming for some people, so the stage crew came up with a way to make the technology easier to use.
All the important things are now controlled via the home automation system and can be controlled with a click on a tablet on the wall.
[As reported,](/freie-bilder-vom-schwoermontag/) we were also on the road to collect **photos under a free license** for Wikipedia and Co—Spoiler Alert, this is also planned for August :)

In addition to all these individual activities, there was of course our **regular programming:** Starting with the **sewing café,** where not only items of clothing were repaired, but visitors also fitted and sewed airy summer clothes themselves.
The **RAD-ikal technisch** crew met to work on measures and projects to promote cycling in the twin city.
As announced, the **Live Let's Plays** are now taking a summer break—but not without having organized one last event at the beginning of July.
The group behind **LoRaWAN and The Things Network** offered two evening events, which could also be used to work in the open **soldering lab**.
The group **Capture the Flag**, that playfully works with IT security, also met twice and **F.U.C.K.** again offered two events.
Last but not least, the workshops were also open twice for **Maker Monday**—although one was postponed by a week due to Schwörmontag.

We also met in July for a **house evening** with all interested parties who are already organizing regular events or would like to do so. Here we discussed current tasks and to-dos.

There are actually a lot of these to-dos, combined with a few exciting additions to the numerous things that are already possible with us. But that will be the subject of an upcoming monthly review :)
