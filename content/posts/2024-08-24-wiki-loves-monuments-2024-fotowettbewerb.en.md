The [Wiki loves Monuments](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Loves_Monuments_2024/Deutschland) photo competition starts again in a few days, on the first of September. All interested photographers are invited to upload photos of cultural monuments from 1 to 30 September and take part in the competition. In addition to fame and honour, there are also book or photo equipment vouchers worth up to EUR 300 up for grabs. Cultural monuments are listed buildings, industrial, technical or garden monuments.

Last year, the view of the cathedral and town hall shown above was also one of the top 100 photos. The Spanish photographer [Diego Delso](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Poco_a_poco/Sobre_m%C3%AD) was apparently visiting Ulm last July and took this photo. It is important to note that the photos do not have to _have been taken_ in September, they just have to have been _uploaded_ for the first time in September and submitted for the competition. So photos that are many years old or even scans of slides or photo negatives can also take part in the competition—the main thing is that you took the photo yourself and make it available under a free licence.

But even if you haven't yet taken a photo of a cultural monument: even in small towns there are practically always some architectural or ground monuments—perhaps you have only ever walked past them and not recognised them as monuments. Therefore, [on an extra page](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Loves_Monuments_2024/Deutschland/Denkmale), there are list pages and also [a map](https://uploadmap.toolforge.org/denkmalde.html) with which you can find the monuments that the Wiki community already knows about.

So take a look around: Are there any cultural monuments in your home town or the surrounding area that do not yet have a photo under a [free licence](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freie_Lizenz)? Or is there perhaps one that you would like to showcase in a completely different and beautiful way? Then try it out—and if you like, submit your photo to the photo competition!
