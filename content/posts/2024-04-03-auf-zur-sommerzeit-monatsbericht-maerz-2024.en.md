Sun! 
Rain! 
Sahara dust! 
Capricious weather! 
But at least it's summertime! 
March brought us all of this, in addition to a total of **19 public events** at the temporärhaus. 
This month, we would like to highlight the lecture on [The Human Cost of AI](/veranstaltungshinweis-die-menschlichen-kosten-der-ki/), the workshop evening [Wikidata loves Basketball](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Ulm/Neu-Ulm&oldid=242462535#Wiki_loves_Basketball_-_Teil_2) and the three-day [LokaliCon meeting of the local community rooms of Wikipedians from nearly all over Germany](/lokalicon-treffen-der-lokalen-community-raeume/) (which only counts once for the statistics despite the three days). 
In addition, a **Kitchen for All** took place for the first time as part of the Climate Alliance, which is also supported by Haus der Nachhaltigkeit.

As the input on the human costs of the current AI hype fitted in so perfectly with the [Ulmer Denkanstößen](https://ulmer-denkanstoesse.de/ulmer-denkanstoesse-2024/thema-2024/), which started a week later, we were able to get Prof. Rebekka Hufendiek to moderate the event.
Mophat Okinyi impressively explained the working conditions of [Clickworkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_job) in his home country of Kenya, for example, who not only make the training of “AI” possible in the first place, but also have to fight their way through hate and violence on the social networks of the relevant tech companies every day as the first moderation instance. 
Thanks to the [CCC Ulm](https://www.ulm.ccc.de/) and Guido Sondern for arranging and collaborating on this programming!

As usual, there were also 15 regular events, from the **OpenStreetMap-Stammtisch** to the **Nähcafé**, **RAD-ikal technisch**, four **Live Let's Plays** and two editions each of **F.U.C.K.**, **Maker Monday**, **CTF/PPP** and the **TTN/LoRaWAN evening**, which, as reported, is now also an open evening for all things related to the electronics lab.

One of the **F.U.C.K.** meetings was about photography and how ASA/ISO, aperture and shutter speed interact. 
Almost trivial for Karo, who usually works on quantum optics during the day. 
Meanwhile, we also played with photography in general to upload images of objects under a free license [on Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Hausfotografie_tempor%C3%A4rhaus_(2024)). 
And as described, we would like to use [our photocopter](/unsere-fotodrohne/) to be able to make aerial shots available to the world as Free Knowledge.

### House construction work, house cleaning weekend, the woodworking workshop and the new atelier

![After the tidying and cleaning work is done, 13 of the weekend's active participants sit down to eat together.](/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/monatsbericht-putz.jpg)

In the monthly reports, we traditionally only include events that are aimed at the general public or groups from within the digital volunteering community. 
As has been the case since the beginning of community work at the Weinhof and also since the reopening in Neu-Ulm, these public events are always complemented by at least as many unofficial, internal and purely voluntary work meetings – if not more.
Practically everything about the infrastructure, from the fast Wi-Fi to the access system to the drinks vending machines, depends on voluntary commitment—and that requires regular work assignments, which are of course more fun together than alone.

In March, this included a **spring cleaning weekend** at the beginning of the month, where we tidied up and reorganized our shared spaces together with the active members of the House of Sustainability, plus cleaning windows, floors and other areas. 
Among other things, we reorganized the electronics lab, dusted, cleaned windows and, last but not least, had brunch together.

![Felix, Max and Jana move a parking ticket machine around the house on two office chairs](/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/monatsbericht-aufraeumen.jpg)

We have moved things and equipment to new locations and, above all, tidied up the workshop. 
Due to a reorganization of the space together with the HdN, we can now set up an atelier space for embroidery, sewing, screen printing, lino printing, cyanotyping and all sorts of other artistic things directly on the other side of the electronics workshop \o/

We have dismantled one bay of the heavy-duty shelving in the wood workshop and procured the necessary shelving stands from Verein funds to create a two-bay heavy-duty shelving unit in the studio area to store all the art supplies. 
Everything we need for all our artistic activities is now stored there.

However, tidying up the workshop was not just about furnishing the atelier space. 
On the one hand, we moved one of the workbenches into the atelier so that people can work there in future. 
And the space freed up by the removal of the shelving is now being used as a place for another mobile workbench.

On the other hand, we now have space in the middle of the wood workshop for the other woodworking tools procured from the [DSEE funding](/jahresendfieber-monatsbericht-november-2023/), which are now in place. 
In over seven years, we have been able to gain a lot of experience with running an open workshop—what do people want to build here, what equipment do they need and, above all, what equipment can you use to get good results even if you don't work with it professionally every day? 
We don't want to give too much away here and would rather describe it in detail in a separate post. 
But if you come to the Maker Mondays, you can already admire the machines - and work with them after running through an introduction workshop!

### What's next

March is followed by April—and on the one hand, a regular new program item from the volunteer work for the general public will be launched, which we will report on soon. 

On the other hand, we are not the only ones who run our shared house, which is why we would like to explicitly refer you to the monthly program of our house-sharing partners at **[Haus der Nachhaltigkeit](https://www.h-d-n.org/)**. 
The photo exhibition is still running in April and is accessible during general opening hours (see both our calendars). 
And the [April program of the HdN](https://download-files.wixmp.com/ugd/aff7d0_e630980bcdcc4fe4b3641e865d21894f.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJ1cm46YXBwOmU2NjYzMGU3MTRmMDQ5MGFhZWExZjE0OWIzYjY5ZTMyIiwic3ViIjoidXJuOmFwcDplNjY2MzBlNzE0ZjA0OTBhYWVhMWYxNDliM2I2OWUzMiIsImF1ZCI6WyJ1cm46c2VydmljZTpmaWxlLmRvd25sb2FkIl0sImlhdCI6MTcxMjE3MDUwMywiZXhwIjoxNzEyMjA2NTEzLCJqdGkiOiJlOGE3Njg0Yi1kOWNmLTRhMTUtOGM2NS1mYTRhYWY0M2I4MWEiLCJvYmoiOltbeyJwYXRoIjoiL3VnZC9hZmY3ZDBfZTYzMDk4MGJjZGNjNGZlNGIzNjQxZTg2NWQyMTg5NGYucGRmIn1dXSwiZGlzIjp7ImZpbGVuYW1lIjoiMjRfMDQgSGROLVByb2dyYW1tLnBkZiIsInR5cGUiOiJhdHRhY2htZW50In19.7IS7yuCLj5zJbinmON4U63C67RZuH33XIT7-zl3pSTQ) includes gems such as a **workshop against right-wing and discriminatory slogans** by the [VVN Ulm](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vereinigung_der_Verfolgten_des_Naziregimes_%E2%80%93_Bund_der_Antifaschistinnen_und_Antifaschisten) and the [FCLR Ulm](https://www.fclr-ulm.de) on 15.4. as well as the **opening of the lending bar** on 18.4., [where you will be able to borrow practical items from a library of things](https://www.h-d-n.org/post/der-leihladen-er%C3%B6ffnet-bald).

Es lohnt sich also, beide Terminkalender im Auge zu behalten.
Und wir würden uns freuen, euch bei uns begrüßen zu können – egal ob bei Angeboten des HdN oder bei uns und egal ob ihr zum ersten Mal da seid oder ob ihr wiederkommt!

So it's worth keeping an eye on both calendars.
And we'd be delighted to welcome you—whether you're here for the first time or coming back!
