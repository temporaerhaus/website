The Jugend hackt Lab offers regular online and offline workshops and open meetings for young adults. Together and with the support of our mentors, we work on creative solutions for the big and small problems of our society, learn new things and exchange ideas. Beginners and experienced people are equally welcome. We are looking forward to meeting you! All dates are **without registration and free of charge**.
