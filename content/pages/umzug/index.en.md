The temporärhaus is looking for a new home in Ulm or Neu-Ulm. Our interim use of the former Sport-Sohn building in downtown Neu-Ulm will end in 2026, so we’re once again searching for a well-suited and long-term usable space of at least 300 m² where we can host workshops and talks, as well as operate our workshop.

If anyone can offer us such spaces or has any leads, we’d appreciate a message at kontakt@temporaerhaus.de.

We’re again looking together with our cohabiting association Haus der Nachhaltigkeit, which increases our overall space requirements. However, if we don’t find a joint location, separate new spaces are also possible.

### Our Requirements

##### Summary
- At least 300 m², preferably more (around 500 m²)
- Long-term lease 
- Accessibility (ideally ground level)
- Event room for talks and presentations 
- Wood workshop and electronics labs (operating evenings)
- 24/7 access 
- Stable funding secured through Wikimedia (“Wikipedia”)

##### Details

In general: Everything is negotiable, and we’re happy to take a look at potential properties. If, for example, 4 out of 5 key points fit, there’s a good chance we can make it work together. 

- At least 300 m² of space for temporärhaus alone. Around 700 m² together with HdN. Best-case: 500 m² alone, 1200 m² jointly.
- Long-term lease preferred, ideally 10 years or more. 
- Stable funding available through Wikimedia Deutschland (“Wikipedia”). 
- Accessibility (required for funding). At least one accessible toilet. Joint renovation possible. 
- Easily reachable by public transport or bicycle. Ideally central, but edge-of-town locations are also fine if suitable. 
- A few parking spaces would be nice but not essential. 
- At least one larger event room for around 50 people (with seating). Additional office rooms required. 
- Possibility for a wood workshop and electronics labs. Ventilation, machine operation (saws, laser cutter, etc.) on 1–2 evenings per week after 5 p.m. Ideally ground floor or with freight elevator (for larger machines like a panel saw). 
- Shop windows or options for outdoor signage would be great. 
- 24/7 access every day of the week (no reception desk or restricted entry). 
- Buildings under historic preservation or with limited renovation options may be less suitable but are not automatically excluded—it depends on the specific case. 
- Important but usually standard: good internet, reliable heating, dry rooms, proper sanitary facilities and plumbing, solid electrical infrastructure (three-phase current strongly preferred).

### Who We Are and What We Do

We’re all about the digital world — from technology to its social and political dimensions. In a nutshell, we offer talks, meetups, and open workshops that include a wood workshop, a “soldering lab” for electronics tinkering, 3D printers, a laser cutter, and many other tools and materials to turn creative ideas into reality. All of this has been available to the general public several evenings per week at our open sessions.

However, the workshops are only the infrastructure we provide. At its core, our mission is about conversation, knowledge exchange, and giving people the chance to experience technology and its human context firsthand. Alongside our open evenings, we also regularly offer free workshops—some specifically for children and teenagers, others open to all age groups. More information about who we are and what we do can be found on our website and in our wiki.

We’d be delighted to receive any offers or suggestions for suitable spaces. Please contact us directly at kontakt@temporaerhaus.de. The Location Search team—Karo and Matthias—can be reached there.
