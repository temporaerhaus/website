May is over—and until the floods at the end of the month, it was almost business as usual. 
Almost, because in southern Germany it was another month in which there was a public holiday practically every week, which is why (and because of illness) a few events were canceled.

Nevertheless, we again had 16 events with the standard program: from the **Sewing Café** to **RAD-ikal technisch** and the **OpenStreetMap regulars' table**, two **Maker Mondays**, two **CTF meetings** and two **open electronics labs with The Things Network/LoRaWAN**. 
Not to forget a meeting of **F.U.C.K.**, a **Jugend hackt Lab** and four **Live Let's Plays**.

As part of the Wikidata competition [Coordinate Me](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Events/Coordinate_Me_2024/de), there was also [a related meeting for interested parties](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Ulm/Neu-Ulm&oldid=245011451#Coordinate_Me) to assign coordinates to Wikidata objects such as hospitals or government buildings. 
In addition to the public schedule, internal organizational and working meetings as well as a plenum of local climate protectors took place as usual.

So far, so unspectacular really. 
Until the last two days of the month, when there were more and more signs that we were threatened not only by persistent heavy rain, but also by flooding—which is why we cleaned the rainwater drains and prepared the house for all eventualities. 
The result in advance: our feet got wet, but there were no serious consequences. 
But that will be the content of the June report :)
