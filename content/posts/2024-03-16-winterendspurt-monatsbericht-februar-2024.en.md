Although February is the shortest month of the year, we still managed to fit in **16 of our own public appointments** in the 29 days – plus an external visit to Backnang, an F.U.C.K. networking workshop in our premises and, of course, lots of internal work assignments.

The **Maker Mondays** continue to be very popular: around 30 and 40 people respectively came to both events and we are delighted that we are able to help so many ideas to become reality every other week. 
On February 5, Maker Monday once again coincided with the **Sewing Café**, so we were able to welcome over 50 people to the house on this day. 
The group around **The Things Network and LoRaWAN** met twice. This group now also offers a general opening time for anyone who would like to get involved with our excellent electronics laboratory equipment outside of IoT technology.

With the **RAD-ikal technisch** group, we have a new monthly offer in cooperation with the ADFC since February.
The focus here is on innovation and experiments relating to bicycles and the mobility transition – for example the [OpenBikeSensors](/wir-bauen-openbikesensoren/), which can be used to measure and evaluate the overtaking distance of passing cars while riding a bicycle.

As usual, the weekly **Live Let's Plays** focused on computer game culture, while the three **Capture the Flag meetings** dealt with a playful approach to IT security. In addition to the regional networking workshop organized by *FLINTA\* and Computerkram*, there were also two **F.U.C.K. evenings** in February, including a soldering workshop where solar lights were built. Last but not least, as in every month, the **OpenStreetMap regulars' table** met in our rooms.

Since the Chaos Communication Camp 2023 at the latest, networking with other self-governed spaces in the region has become much tighter.
 On February 3 and 4, a group of activists from Neu-Ulm visited Backnang for a networking meeting. 
Many thanks for the hospitality and the exchange!

In addition to all our events, there was of course an equally impressive collection of events organized by the House of Sustainability in the shared rooms. We would like to highlight the **Method Lab Liberating Structures,** which we also promoted via our calendar.
Away from the public eye, there was also plenty to do behind the scenes:

Not only are we still gradually putting the procurements from the DSEE funding into operation, we are still receiving exciting things :)
In February, we received a fun addition from the team at [Widerstand und Söhne](https://www.widerstandundsoehne.de/), who left us two large LED matrices that they no longer had any use for.
We don't yet know exactly where to put them, but the first test showed that they look pretty!

![Henning looks very pleased at the camera. He rests his hand on the freshly assembled milling table in the wood workshop.](/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/monatsbericht-fraestisch.jpg)

Also looking pretty is our new milling table, which Henning is visibly happy about in this picture. 
And we already know where we want to put it (the milling table, that is, not Henning). 
After Seppi had adapted and rebuilt the table, it now expands our skills in the wood workshop even further. 
This is another great new piece of hardware that we were able to get through the DSEE grant – but due to the many new acquisitions, the wood workshop will soon receive its own report. 
And something else changed in the workshop in February: The temporary dust curtain was replaced with a not-quite-so-temporary molleton curtain. 

Our housemates from the House of Sustainability were also busy in front of and behind the scenes in February.
As far as shared infrastructure is concerned, the kitchen has enjoyed a proper upgrade and is now better equipped than ever before.
Last but not least, to coincide with the Weeks Against Racism in March, the HdN team replaced the "Better Images of AI" photo exhibition in the salon with photographs from the Photovoice project by young people from Germany and South Africa.

The final spurt through the last weeks of winter can begin!
