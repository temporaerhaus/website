[LaTeX](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is an enormously powerful software package for digital text typesetting, which is mainly – but not only – used in science for typographically beautifully set texts.
From scientific papers to [DIN-compliant letters](https://de.overleaf.com/latex/templates/din-a4-letter-template-with-scrlttr2/tpvycrryrmrg) (with fold and hole punch marks!) to [theses](https://de.overleaf.com/latex/templates/classic-thesis-style-v4-dot-2-by-andre-miede/dwgtvykzvdtk) or entire books (including all graphs and plots in them), a great many things can be put into a respectable form with this typesetting system.

Die-hard users of this system have been meeting for a long time at decentralized regulars' tables, but also at interregional meetings.
The Bavarian LaTeX regulars' tables have been organizing the annual Bavarian TeX conference **BayTeX** since 2003, and from 2006 to 2009 also with the support of the LaTeX regulars' table Ulm and [last time actually _in_ Ulm in 2006](http://web.archive.org/web/20070912060909/http://latex.in-ulm.de/ie/baytex/).

**All the better that BayTeX is returning to Neu-Ulm: [On Saturday, September 7, 2024, BayTex will take place in the temporärhaus!](https://baytex.in-ulm.de/)**
The event is expected to last from 10 am to 6 pm.
You can find more information, the link to register and the opportunity to submit your own contributions [on the event page](http://web.archive.org/web/20070912060909/http://latex.in-ulm.de/ie/baytex/)
Many thanks to Leah Neukirchen for the organization and the opportunity to host BayTex here!
