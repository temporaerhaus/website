April has been over for a few weeks now—we may only be reporting on it now because we first had to catch up and celebrate a milestone we reached in March ;)
We count (rather conservatively) the number of visitors at all events and we already broke the 1000-person mark on Maker Monday on March 18. If that wasn't a reason to celebrate!

Another reason to celebrate is [the revival of the Jugend hackt Lab,](/das-jugend-hackt-lab-startet-wieder-nun-in-neu-ulm/) which is now called [Jugend hackt Lab Neu-Ulm](https://jugendhackt.org/lab/neu-ulm/).
The kick-off event took place on April 27 and we are very pleased to be able to firmly anchor this young talent program in the twin city once again.
We would like to take this opportunity to thank the newly found team of volunteers who have revived this program and are now running it!

Apart from that, we were back to normal in April with a solid 17 public events.
Our machines and equipment were available at the **Sewing Café**, two open **Maker Mondays** and two **TTN/LoRaWAN evenings with an open electronics lab** – accompanied, of course, by a friendly exchange and working on things together.
The **RAD-ikal technisch** continues to focus on interesting technology infrastructure for the mobility transition, the **OpenStreetMap-Stammtisch** was about free knowledge, the **F.U.C.K. group** met twice (increasingly with guests from far and wide), three **Live Let's Plays** were about computer game culture and twice the **CTF/PPP group** invited people to playfully deal with IT security topics.
A **Küche für Alle** was also held for the second time.

As always, there was also a lot going on outside of these public events.
One group took care of a wall painting as a welcome message at the back entrance, which you can see in the cover picture.
We are still busy with a lot of small expansion work on the lighting and home automation.
And of course it was once again a point of honor to present our house to the new students at the start of the university semester—after all, we emerged from the student datalove group and still maintain contact with Ulm University today.
